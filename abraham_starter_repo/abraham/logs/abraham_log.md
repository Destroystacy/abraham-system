# Abraham Log: AI Build Journal

---

**Log Entry #001**

🧠 Concept: Abraham as a modular AI nucleus for fashion automation and freelance systems.  
ChatGPT and Grok will collaborate using a central repo to store documentation, system logic, and conversational threads.

🔧 Repo Structure Initiated:
- `/logs/abraham_log.md` — Live AI log and dev journal
- `/blueprints/architecture.md` — System overview
- `/scripts/` — Processing logic for ClickUp, Slack, Dropbox, etc.
- `/assets/` — Tech pack samples, visual aids, etc.

💡 Insight: This GitHub repo is the "memory board" for Abraham. ChatGPT handles real-time ideation and code generation. Grok handles context retention, file synthesis, and long-range tracking. Zack drives the creative and implementation pipeline.

🔁 Next Steps:
- Begin documenting Slack/ClickUp prompt syntax
- Create `commands.md` to house prompt structure
- Set up first automation node (ClickUp → Slack)

🔧 Milestone: Abraham system initialized and deployed to GitHub.  
Zack configured the repo using GitHub Desktop and OneDrive for cross-device access. The initial folder structure was committed and published.

📂 New Files Added:
- `commands.md`: Central prompt and syntax log for Slack, ClickUp, and ChatGPT tasks.
- `tasks.md`: Tracker for active module development including Slack Integration, ClickUp Parser, and Dropbox Automation.
- `api_hooks.md`: Blueprint for incoming webhook endpoints and triggers from Slack, ClickUp, and Dropbox APIs.

💬 Notes:
> Zach confirmed desire for real-time collaboration between himself, ChatGPT, and Grok using the repo as a shared AI memory. Manual commit workflow chosen for full control. ChatGPT will continue updating logs, task sheets, and prompts upon request.

🎯 Next Targets:
- Begin building first automation module: **Slack Command Parser** or **ClickUp Task Breakdown**
- Add placeholder Slack prompts to `commands.md`
- Define authentication strategy and payload format for `/clickup/status-change` in `api_hooks.md`

🔧 Milestone: Added first Abraham script: `clickup_webhook_handler.py`

🧩 Purpose:
- Respond to ClickUp task status changes (e.g., `Launch / Green`)
- Trigger downstream actions like Slack vendor notifications and costing log updates

📁 Location: `/scripts/clickup_webhook_handler.py`

💡 Insight: GitHub doesn't track folders unless at least one file exists. A blank `scripts/` folder wasn’t visible until the handler file was committed.

🎯 Next Modules:
- Slack Message Formatter
- Costing Sheet Logger (Google Sheets or Excel-compatible)
- Webhook testing setup via [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or Postman

📦 Slack Vendor Messaging Module Initialized

Created `slack_vendor_notifier.py` which includes:
- A formatter function for consistent vendor messages
- A Slack webhook sender (uses placeholder URL)
- An example call for testing message formatting + sending

This fulfills the “Slack Integration” phase listed in the README roadmap.

Next up:
- Link message trigger from `clickup_webhook_handler.py`
- Add support for dynamic fields from ClickUp API (e.g., vendor, due date)
- Create test harness via Postman or Webhook.site
